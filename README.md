Hi everyone! My name is Alexia Holcombe. I'm 20 years old. I'm from the biggest state of America, if you're good in geography you will now what state I'm talking about. if you're not good at it, I'm from Texas. Yeehaw! I'm half latin, half white. I was raised most of my life in Mexico. I'm a friendly, kind, curious and active person. Those are one of the things that i can use to describe mysellf. I'm currently living in Washington state, I move up here last year. All my family is in Texas and also in Mexico. I came to Washington to persue my career as a software engineer, also I want to learn fluently English, so if you notice bad grammer or anything related is because I'm still learning English. Just in case if you are curious like me, my first language is Spanish obviously.
